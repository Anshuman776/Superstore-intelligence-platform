# 📊 Superstore Intelligence Engine (ML-Driven Retail Analytics with AI Strategy Support)


This repository contains the source code for an enterprise-grade MLOps platform designed to provide customer intelligence and operational insights for e-commerce.

Moving beyond simple notebooks, this project demonstrates a **modular, production-ready pipeline** that handles data engineering, generative synthetic augmentation, parallel model training, and explainable AI deployment.

## 💼 Business Problem

Retail organizations struggle with:

- Predicting whether an order will be profitable before fulfillment
- Identifying customers at risk of churn
- Designing effective cross-sell strategies
- Explaining model decisions to business stakeholders

This platform addresses these challenges by combining machine learning
profitability forecasting, customer segmentation, predictive market
basket analysis, explainable AI auditing, and AI-assisted executive
strategy generation.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

This platform is architected as a sequential MLOps pipeline, emphasizing reproducibility, schema enforcement, and the prevention of training-serving skew.

### **1. Data Engineering & Augmentation (`src/`)**
* **`01_ingest_and_clean.py`**: The ETL pipeline. Ingests raw CSVs, enforces strict Parquet schema, removes statistical outliers (IQR method), and fixes domain logic errors.
    * **Output:** `data/processed/cleaned_superstore_data.parquet`
* **`02_auto_eda_report.py`**: Automated health checks. Generates a comprehensive visual report to validate data distribution before training begins.
    * **Output:** `reports/comprehensive_eda_report/*.png`
* **`03_augment_data_gen.py`**: The Generative AI layer. Trains a **CTGAN** to learn customer distributions and generates 30,000+ synthetic transactions.
    * **Output:** `data/processed/synthetic_base_transactions.parquet`
    * **Model Artifact:** `models/ctgan_synthesizer.pkl` (Saved generator for future sampling)

### **2. The Model Training Farm (`src/`)**
* **`04a_train_profit_engine.py`**: Trains the "Deal Desk" logic using a two-stage approach (Risk + Magnitude) on a hybrid (Real + Synthetic) dataset.
    * **Output Artifacts:**
        * `models/final_v3_profitability_classifier.joblib` (The Gatekeeper)
        * `models/final_v3_profit_forecaster.joblib` (The Estimator)
* **`04b_train_segmentation.py`**: Trains a **Keras Autoencoder** to compress RFM data into a latent space for non-linear clustering.
    * **Output Artifacts:**
        * `models/customer_encoder_model.keras` (Neural Network)
        * `models/rfm_scaler.joblib` (Required for normalizing input data)
* **`04c_train_recommender.py`**: Trains a "Predictive Market Basket" model to predict product compatibility based on item features.
    * **Output Artifacts:**
        * `models/final_predictive_mba_classifier.joblib`

### **3. Audit & Explainability**
* **`05_generate_explainability.py`**: Generates **SHAP** plots to provide "White Box" transparency for the profit models.
    * **Output:** `reports/shap_summary_beeswarm.png`, `reports/shap_summary_bar.png`

### **4. Shared Logic (`common/`)**
* **`features.py`**: A centralized Feature Store module. Contains the `create_master_feature_set()` logic used by both Training and Inference pipelines to mathematically guarantee **Zero Training-Serving Skew**.

### **5. Deployment (`app.py`)**
* A multi-page **Streamlit** dashboard serving real-time inferences.
* **AI Strategy Co-Pilot**: Integrates **Gemini Pro** to read model outputs and draft strategic business memos for executives.

## ☁️ Deployment

The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

The deployment pipeline:

- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Loads trained model artifacts from `/models`
- Reads processed Parquet datasets from `/data/processed`
- Uses `.streamlit/secrets.toml` for API keys

## ⚙️ Setup and Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anshuman776/Superstore-intelligence-platform.git
    cd Superstore-intelligence-platform
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
